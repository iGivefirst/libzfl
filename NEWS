Reorganized configuration classes
- zfl_device class replaces zfl_config, specifically for configuring devices
- zfl_config class replaces zfl_tree
- zfl_config_json replaces zfl_tree_json
- zfl_config_zpl replaces zfl_tree_zpl
- zfl_config_load autodetects JSON and ZPL input, parses accordingly
- zfl_config_load allows filename to be "_" meaning "read from stdin"
- zfl_config_save saves config tree in ZPL format (new method)
- zfl_config_save allows filename to be "_" meaning "write to stdout"
- examples/zdevice updated to use new classes

Started on zfl_thread class
- zfl_thread_new, _destroy, _wait methods

Add zfl_hash_freefn to allow heap-allocated item values

Improvements to zfl_rpc and zfl_rpcd
- resolved various memory leaks
- code cleanups for consistency with other ZFL classes
- added zfl_rpc_test and zfl_rpcd_test selftest methods
- added documentation stubs
